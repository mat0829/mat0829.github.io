<p>My name is David Mathew Anderson but everyone who knows me calls me Mat. I am born and raised in Las Vegas, NV except for two brief stays elsewhere, one on Long Island, NY, and one on Oahu, HI. I recently relocated to Eugene, Oregon after almost a decade of my wife and I working to get there. I have red hair and blue eyes. I Love to sing and I even used to take Brazilian Jiu jitsu for fun. I have worked for Gordon Ramsay and now I wish to finally complete my lifetime of computer Love into a career. I am very artistic and logical and I think that this field will be a perfect fit for me. I am what is known as a Suicide Survivor which means that I have lived through the suicide of a Loved one. I mention this because I want this blog to show the normal struggles of any one of us in this bootcamp during our time learning to code along with the technical aspects, but also to, I hope, serve as inspiration to anyone else that is going through something that adds another struggle into the mix. </p>
