# So I decided to go back today to the beginning and then to go back yet again, in the same day, to start taking notes. Turns out that taking notes takes some time. I am certain that it is the right way to go, thus the reason I justified it when I am already so pressured on time. I want to do this right though. I made two files, One for just notes and one for terms and definitions. This is going to bite into my estimates time but not too much and I am sure it will save time later and reinforce the knowledge. I mean there has to be a reason it's done. Onward! From now on I will be doing one of these a day I think. I am spamming by accident. Maybe I should consolidate these later too...
# Ok, last time today I swear :) So I have been just trying to be a beast adding terms and definitions and notes and I am realizing that the notes side will have to go. It's just unrealistic due to the sheer volume of stuff that can be argued is worthy of being written down. I was writing down the whole damn course. I will just have to rely on the fact that I can search easily through Learn and stick to just the notes and terms. I have kept the file for notes but I will have to rethink how to use it if I choose to bring it back. At the moment I mush on!
