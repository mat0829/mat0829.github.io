  It's finally here! All the time, effort, and pushing myself to my limits is finally paying off. I am finished with my Final Project for Flatiron! I am so over the moon! 
<br>
<br>
  For my Final Project I had to make an App with a Rails Backend and a React-Redux front end. I got permission to attempt to upgrade my Javascript Project Stickers to React if it met all the requirements which is more than satisfied. I thought that it wouldn't be that difficult but I forgot that in my Javascript Project the note I got was to break up my code into smaller, more readable, pieces. Even though I had it clean, it was just vast. Well, I thought this was poetic to remember that one of React's benefits is breaking up everything into Components or smaller, more manageable pieces of code. 
<br>
<br>
   It was a challenge for sure but the functionality of this version of Stickers v.s. the original is leaps and bounds. It's better in almost every way. I am in awe of how fast it does the same stuff and how much easier it was, once I got my groove, to get it to do the things it did before and so much more. Before it, the pages I had to make so much logic to get it to do the simplest things and it was difficult, even for me who wrote it and labeled each section of code with comments in the original, to find things. Now it is all seperated so beautifully. I adore cleanness and this is beautiful to behold compared. 
<br>
<br>
  I still, like everyone I am sure, have things I want to do like username and email recovery. I want it to scroll cleaner and better timed. I want more things to move and do things and to add sounds for victories like completing a Task or buying a Prize. I also want to make it so making a Task can be for all Child Users at once rather than having to do it multiple times for multiple kids. Could be fun to make a Task that is like a race to see who finishes it and gets the points. For the Prizes especially I think this would be fun and beneficial. 
<br>
<br>
  I want Stickers to do many things between Parents/Guardians and Kids. I want it to build good habits through a reward system that is as humble or ridiculous as the Task maker chooses. I want it to be fun for all kids and many of the Prizes were chosen specificially for that reason. I want them to be something that is easy to do and reward, yet beneficial and motivational to the kids. I remember as a child that staying up past your bedtime, getting out of doing chores, and getting to go on some kind of adventure was awesome! I wanted that to come across in Stickers. I also wanted it to build a great and powerful trust system between the Parents and Children. A Parent sets a Task with a Prize of a Sticker which is collected digitally, and an amount of Sticker Points. They then make Prizes of their choosing that the Kids are able to choose from. They can learn discipline along with how to not only do things like chores and complete Tasks that are before them but also to spend wisely. They could spend their points quickly on something low in points like a piece of candy for instant gradification, or they can save up to get something more significant like a pizza for dinner, or even going to a theme park! The Tasks and Prizes are not limited to the images I have chosen either. They can be named whatever you wish and you can bring it your own pictures for either pasting in a picture's url. 
<br>
<br>
I upgraded Stickers to much better than the original version like adding more details for each Task and Prize including the name, a small task image, and the Child it is for. I also added the ability to sort the Tasks or Prizes by a specific Child.

  I am in awe of the fact that I am about to schedule my Final Assessment. I have worked so hard. I was not a straight A student who was fantastic at studying. I was not the smartest kid in class. I always had a good imagination and creativity but I had to learn to even be a student and build myself up from there. Today I am proud to know that I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I know how to build things from 0 to 100%. Backend and Front. I know multiple ways even! I understand arrays and, what once blew my mind, arrays and other things within arrays and other things. I have built out things that blow my own mind! I am so excited to pass my Final Assessment and finally be able to look myself in the mirror and know I am a Flatiron Full Stack Web Development Graduate!
