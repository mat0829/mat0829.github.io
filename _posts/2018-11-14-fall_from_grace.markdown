# I am finally starting to understand what was said earlier in this course about learning to think like a programmer. I have been a high volume server and in addition to that I was a trainer of other servers due to my good habits and ability to consolidate, antipate, etc. I am starting to see how these same skills will come into play as I become more and more efficient at programming. 
   # In Ruby especially, due to the ability to make it your own, I am starting to understand this. I have already started talking in code to my wife such as referring to variables, else/if, etc as how I am understanding things now in a new way. I even realized that the constantly updating Hulu recommended list was an array or probably a nested array, which is being run through each time you look at something to keep the recommendations fresh and accurate as possible. 
	 # Today I am trying to add in a version of the Pomodoro Technique as suggested by Avi in one of his videos though I can't place the exact one at the moment. It is a way to study and how to break up your time while attempting to keep yourself from overloading by giving yourself short breaks after each chunk of studying. I am using the 45 minutes of study, 15 minute break version as there are many variations. 
	    # The biggest thing I notice as I get used to this is being scared every 45 minutes by the alarm on my phone,lol. I am just not used to it yet and I get buried in this, as most computer people do, just like I used to when I would tech a computer for viruses, spyware, or issues, etc. I am guilty of not taking breaks normally and slowly driving myself, and my wife, crazy. I am doing this to correct this mistake as I know that burning out is a serious concern when absorbing so much information, especially given the challenge of it.
		# So far it has been working great though I must confess that it is closer to a 20 minute break. The honest reason is because I Love anime and I found that, once you account for skipping the intro and the ending, it's around 18 minutes or so. Add in a restroom break and that's about 20 minutes. I chose to watch the animes because I greatly enjoy them due to their complex plots like Claymore, Attack on Titan, Swordart Online, etc. in addition to the fact that I am directly distracted for the break. I think that is important to make sure it is not too long and that I actually relax during that time.
		# As far as progress from the last blog where I went back to the beginning to take notes properly back to the point I was at, I am pretty close to caught up. I am sure the notes will be more challenging to make efficient as the subjects grow in complexity but I am already seeing a HUGE help from them. I can just quickly reference back and even just read my notes from top to bottom in a reasonable amount of time to refresh myself quickly on the parts of the course I have already completed. This is so beneficial I can't even explain. Sometimes, even with coffee in my blood and full intentions, stuff will get away from me. By making the notes I have to think out how to write it which reinforces the knowledge in addition to quickly being able to go back when I do find something has disappeared from my knowledge. It was disheartening at first, without a doubt, but I fully stand it will be well worth the time in the end. Back to battle!
