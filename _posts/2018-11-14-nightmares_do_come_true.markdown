# As the title implies, I am starting at the beginning, quite literally. I have been doing this since July but I have not been at my best and I was all over the place with my study habits. I decided to weed out the things I needed to that were distractions to the extent of not watching tv or anything except in the evening and not getting on Facebook anymore to avoid distractions. I have never been a great student but I am taking advice from Avi's videos and from my amazing wife, who earned Summa Cum Laude in UNLV. 

# This blog is for all those out there that are weren't superstars in school. For those who have been through the ringer and yet refused to give up. I am going to write in this often and more and more with technical details but that will have to come later and here's why: I am starting over this entire course over, in a respect. I am far, or it feels that way after all the time and struggle to get where I am, but I am not how I wish to be. I am not confident in my knowledge and I want to be. 

# I have decided to make the following changes which I have already started: First, I decided to go all the way back to the beginning of this course. I chose to do this for multiple reasons the biggest of which is I now realize the value of notes which I didn't take. Again, I am not a great student in my life previously. I am juggling learning how to be a student and learning to learn, in addition to learning web development. Sure, I might lose my mind but I feel that's a risk for all of us. 

# I also wished to go back to reread all that I had read up to this point and to do things I skipped the first time like clicking on all the blue links at the bottom of the lessons for extra knowledge and going back to ideas I struggled more with. I also have decided to rewatch all the videos and some of them I will continue to watch over and over again until I am confident that I have exhausted everything I can absorb from them. 

# This might seem trivial to do for some of you superstars out there but it was a hard hard choice for me to make. I am older and time is a constant concern along with a desire to break free of the back breaking jobs I have done previously. I am not the smartest, so I don't have that going for me, but I am stubborn. I am basically just banking on my refusal to give up and being too dense to know when and if I should. I will never know because I am stubborn and I simply won't give up. It's not in me. This will be my continued adventures in my quest to become a Full Stack Web Developer. 

# P.S. I will try to make it entertaining in addition to being informative of my personal journey.
