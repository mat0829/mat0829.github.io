# Well, I am pretty proud today as yesterday I fine tuned the machine that is me even more. I cut out all tv, even on breaks, during study time. I let people know that I will not be on Facebook for a while as I found it to be a distraction. I also managed to pull back my start time today to 9:00 am which is great! I am excited and very nervous as usual. The truth is, especially given the content matter of my other posts and the complete lack of anyone reaching out to me, despite being shown on the Learn Magazine site, I doubt these words are being read by anyone. I used to be very bitter about it and I still admit I am still often but I let it control me less. I am used to being ignored because nobody wants to acknowledge suicide exists. It's too uncomfortable. In the end though I am not doing this, Flatiron, for that reason. I just saw this blog as an opportunity to share my struggle and my journey as a possible inspiration to others. I doubt it will be and I fear I might get in trouble due to the content. I think I should probably include a Graphic Content warning in the beginning of my blog which I will add in later when I start tinkering with it. Right now I am torn between going back to the beginning and just rereading everything, which I have done before but not since I got stone sober, or attempting to push on. Realistically I probably should go back as I know that very soon I will be tested on my competancy on the subject matter for this part of the course. I mentioned my fears yesterday to my wife and she brushed them away. That's her job though and in addition to that she sincerely believes in me in this, probably more than I believe in myself. I am going to attempt to treat it like Brazilian jiu jitsu or high volume serving or anything else I get tunnel visioned with and just use my sheer will and determination to, hopefully, conquer this. As of now my emotional state comes and goes with this course. Sometimes I feel like I can do it so well and other times I wonder what the Hell I have been doing this whole time previously. I mean, I just haven't been as polished as I could be, and that's putting in mildly. I feel confident that I made the right decision but now I must face the reality of the challenge itself and it is daunting. I don't think I am a super star in intelligence like my wife. I wasn't a super star in school. The only reason I graduated was one, because my father didn't believe I would as all my friends had dropped out, and two because I got into theater by accident and ended up Loving it. I was telling my wife how hard this is for me. I am simultaneously juggling my newly reestablished sobriety, attempting to fine tune myself to learn to be a student after never being a great one in my past, dealing with the reality of my father's passing and how, and taking on this bootcamp which is the hardest thing I have ever done on an intellectual level. Everyday now I just obsess about how I can improve. I normally talk to me wife on the phone as she drives home and I decided that I could use that extra half hour or so each day to add to school study time. She takes a shower I grab the laptop. I make it sound now like I am so polished but I am such a babe in the woods. This is not my strong suit. I can do so many things well naturally that I am able to half alot of stuff and get away with it. This of course bred bad habits in life which I am now, at 38 years old, attempting to fix. Man, it sucks! Let me tell you. I am not a powerhouse student though I always wished that I had been. I messed up so much of my life and this is my chance to do the final step at rectifying it. I have many things in life that I have honed and fine tuned but I think the greatest thing I have going for me is I don't know how to give up. Even after my dad died and I broke, and I fell down, so so far, I always knew I would fight my way back. This is pretty much all I have going for me right now. Just a blind faith that I can do this despite any logical or illogical reasons I can come up with and they seem endless. I keep thinking I should fail because my last 3 years have been so hard and I have fallen so far. Sober though I will admit I am much better at thinking realistically about the truth of the things I have done. I have done great things in my past. Hell, even putting myself back together and getting sober again or not drinking again in the first place still since 2007 despite his suicide is a major feat that few will understand. The truth is, above almost anything else, I feel alone alot. Alone in this journey. My wife could not be more supportive but it wasn't her father that passed and there is alot of my experience that I can never put to words to her or anyone else. Much like experiencing Love it's almost impossible to define to someone who has not. I don't have friends on here. I even fear this blog itself, despite my sincere good intentions for me and any potential readers, I fear could get me kicked out. I can't seem to bring myself to delete or change it though and I have thought so many times about deleting it. It's so raw and so few will be able to read it and even fewer will relate. I am an island. Sometimes it sucks. I need to break free of this thought pattern right now though and jump back to my goals. My goals today are to atleast look more at the #slack channel, and start my in depth review of the material up to this point. I am hoping I can bang that out today as I have the labs etc. completed already but I am not sure if that is realistic. I need to solidify the material. I obsess with knowing it inside out. I won't be content until I do. I won't be content until I am flying high again from my own determination. I need it for me and for my confidence... in life. I have been through alot and it took alot out of me and this course is fucking hard! I mean, fuck! On the same note I Love Love Love the idea of once again doing something that seems impossible. I thrive in environments like that. I don't know why? Anyways, I have been writing for a rediculous amount of time already on this but I wanted to write everyday I can to further discipline myself and to prove to anyone watching me from the school how much I want this. I am going to fine tune myself like I always have in other walks of life until I am as efficient as possible. I want to be able to look back, one way or the other, and know, know that I did the best I could. That I gave it my all. My walk is unlike so many other's and I would be lying through my teeth if I didn't admit jealousy for many others for so many reason ranging from financial freedom where they never knew what it was like to fear, to people who have never lost anyone. I have more regrets that I can believe. I wish that I had been like my wife in school and taken it seriously rather than trying to be popular or whatever I was. I chose poorly. I have righted so so many wrongs in my life but the fact that I never learned to be a good student is a rough one to have to contend with as I juggle what I think is one of the most challenge things I can think of in this bootcamp. Well, back to my sheer refusal to give up. Here I go...wish me luck. I could use it and it has never seemed to be on my side.
