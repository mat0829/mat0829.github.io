# I have been going through this course from the beginning to just solidify my knowledge and to make sure I am competent for when I am tested on my knowledge for this section soon. I now realize I must go back again, twice in the same day, to start again while taking notes at the same time. Ugh! I am annoyed but that is the nature of the fine tuning beast. I want to do this right and I know I need notes which I have previously lacked. I also wanted to use the notes to make flash cards etc. for my wife to use with me to help reinforce my knowledge further. So, again...today, I am going back to the beginning. Yay...Better to do it right though I assume, thus the reason I am going back now. I hope this is worth it.
