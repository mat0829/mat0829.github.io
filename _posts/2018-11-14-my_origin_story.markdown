  I got into web development because of my father. My father has been prepping me for a career in computers since I was literally around 5 years old and I am now 38. He sat me down and encouraged me to not only learn computers but to not be intimidated by them. He did this through adding in games with teaching built in or just allowing me to play games in general like Alf when computers were still black screens with green writing and later with Manhole when they later became colored. He understood the wish to have me doing something with my mind rather then my body. My dad is my Hero and I also want to do this to complete his dream. This has become a huge deal to me as I lost him in 2015 to suicide. I am what is known as a suicide survivor. I wish to do this and to do it well. I wish to take all my artistic abilities and my logical abilities and to make amazing things through web design. I already have a memo on my phone full of ideas for websites that I am dying to make. I want to show that anyone can take web design and learn it, even if they are at a disadvantage.

  I want to do this for my dad who believed in me always as much as I believed in him, for my beautiful wife who believes I can do anything, and for anyone who is reading this while taking this course and wishing to give up because of how difficult it is. I want to show that it doesn't matter. If you want it bad enough, nothing can stop you. I won't allow anything to stop me because I do so sincerely and whole heartedly want this. This field is amazing for so many reasons starting from the truth that it has a huge projected growth market for the future where many jobs, such as the ones I have had in the past as a server, do not and may be going away in time. I love that most tech companies have amazing benefits and they really treat you amazing. I want to matter. I recently had the privilage of being able to help my wife quit her job as a server to go back to school. This overlapped my father's sudden passing which made this road much much more difficult. In addition to this we also had a long term plan to get from Las Vegas, NV to Eugene, OR. Well, let me put it this way, she graduated Summa Cum Laude from UNLV and landed a job in Eugene and I am writing now from our leased condo in Eugene right now. We are both very determined people and we know what we want. After my father's passing and how he passed I was left with alot of....issues, that I had to address and work through. I am on the other side as a whole though and I am so determined to just absorb this bootcamp and become a Full Stack Web Developer!
